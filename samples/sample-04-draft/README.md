# Getting Started

This sample demonstrates the plugin with draft activated entities. You can configure your ranges to be created either in draft mode or after draft activation. Keep in mind that key fields must be configured in draft mode. 

To run it locally, perform npm install first:

```
npm install
```

Then, you can run cds watch:

```
cds watch
```
